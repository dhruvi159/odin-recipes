        <p>If you love the television show The Bear as much as we do, it's likely you were also excited about the short
            ribs Sydney works on perfecting during the entire first season of the show. On television and in real life,
            nothing is cozier than a Dutch oven filled with braised, fall-off-the-bone tender short ribs served over
            risotto. Here, per Sydney's creativity, the classic wine and stock braising liquid get a surprising addition
            from cola, which balances the savory with a touch of complex sweetness to create a smooth, rich sauce. </p>
