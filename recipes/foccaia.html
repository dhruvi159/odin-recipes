    <h1>Foccoaia Bread</h1>
    <div>
        <p>This is the perfect unfussy focaccia recipe, that bakes up into a light bread full of flavor from the oil,
            salt, and herbs. It's the perfect thickness for sandwich bread or slicing into strips and serving with
            charcuterie, dips, salads, or pasta. The dough proofs overnight in the refrigerator, where it rises and
            develops gluten. It's easy to pull it out the next day for a final rise and shaping before you bake it. The
            rosemary is a classic focaccia topping; feel free to add other herbs and goodies at the final stage to
            personalize it to your tastes.</p>
